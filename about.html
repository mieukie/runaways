        <h1 class="aboutHdr">ABOUT THE RUNAWAYS</h1>
            <p class="aboutP">The Runaways are a group of seven experienced adventurers currently residing in Waterdeep. This unique group of unlikely heroes, formed from the flames of a chaotic mistake, have experienced a wide variety of life-threatening perils, thrilling escapades, and comical shenanigans. Now, they must work together to learn how to manage a not-so-ordinary tavern in the very town where they first began. Learn more about their full story <a href="story.html">here</a>.</p>
            
        <h2 class="aboutHdr" id="aboutHdr2">ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h2>
            <p class="aboutP" id="aboutP2">If you're reading this, you already know all this stuff about the Runaways because you play one or more of its characters. This project was created for the purpose of learning the basics of web development and also because I thought it would look cool. It turned out kind of messy and definitely isn't compatible with mobile, but the process of putting it together has taught me a lot. This website definitely wouldn't have been possible without you guys' art and characters, so thanks! Hope you enjoy looking around! <br><br>-Miyuki</p>
            <!--You probably already know all this stuff about the Runaways because, if you're on this website, you play one (or even two) of its characters. And there's also a high probability that your art is all over it too, so really this is your website as much as its mine! This website was created mainly for the purpose of learning the basics of web development and web design skills. I chose to build a website about the Runaways not only because they're a fun group and using them as a topic motivates me to keep working on it, but also to centralize and document some of the party's history and content. Taking the time to search for and look back on all the art, slideshows, headcanons, writing, etc. and the memories associated with them has given me a renewed sense of appreciation for these characters and the stories they've helped us to create. This project serves as a kind of love letter to that and to them, and definitely wouldn't have been possible without all the art or story from you guys reading this right now, so thank you!<br><br>All that being said, this website still is also still for learning purposes! So if you see anything that's messed up please let me know so I can fix it and be aware of it for next time. I'd also appreciate any input on the design, positioning of stuff, how easy it was to navigate the content, etc. Thanks again for taking time to read all this and I hope you enjoy looking through the site! <br><br>-Miyuki-->
